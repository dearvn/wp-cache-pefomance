Easy ways to speed up your WordPress site in 2023

A very fast caching engine for WordPress that produces static html files.

The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users:

* Users who are not logged in.
* Users who have not left a comment on your blog.
* Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.

99% of your visitors will be served static html files. One cached file can be served thousands of times. Other visitors will be served custom cached files tailored to their visit. If they are logged in, or have left comments those details will be displayed and cached for them.
